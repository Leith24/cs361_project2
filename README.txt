Hey, we will probably need some sort of timer to record our bandwidth. My WiFi connection here is a little shaky for some reason right now, so I was only able to get the out file working, the log working, the errors gone, and the verbose working. I wasn't able to get a good start on actually putting info into the files because the shell connection kept terminating.
